## How to ask a tech question? <a id="tech"></a>

Coding is tough. You will run into problems and you will get stuck. Communicating the problem you are experiencing can be as big of a challenge as fixing the problem itself. Here are some helpful tips when you run into problems and get stuck.

<ul>
    <li>Talk about your problem! One of the reasons we utilize pair-programming is to encourage communication about coding. If you are both stuck talk to the duck.</li>
    <li>Pseudo coding is the term developers use for translating the code into sentence structure. This can help you create a step by step plan for your problem and a point of reference when you get stuck.</li>
    <li>Learn your programming vocabulary so can correctly identify the problem you are having.</li>
    <li>Double check your indentations and syntax. Use the built in functionality of the text editor to make sure all your tags, parentheses, and curly braces close. Typos are very common errors.</li>
    <li>Read your error messages! Errors are a great way to fix your code. Error messages will often contain the file and the line the error where the error occurred.</li>
    <li>Google your error message and language in which you are coding. You are probably not the first person to have this problem.</li>
    <li>Use dev tools and console.log to inspect the page and look for where your error occurs. Make sure the problem you think you have is actually the problem you have.</li>
    <li>Ask your fellow students for help. They may have come across a similar problem.</li>
    <li>Ask the instructors. We will have you walk through your code so make sure everything is formatted properly and you can explain the problem you are having.</li>
</ul>

## Pair Programming

At Learn we utilize a method of collaboration called pair programming. This means we have one screen, one computer and two people. We have two keyboards and mice to make the transition between rolls easier, but only one keyboard/mouse set should be used at a time.

### Driver and Navigator

The `driver` is the one with their hands on the keyboard. They are responsible for entering information and following the instructions given by the `navigator`. It is important to switch roles every 10-20 minutes and take frequent breaks. Communication is vital!


<ul>
    <li>Increased specialization requires more collaboration</li>
    <li>Different people have different knowledge and strengths which can lead to better solutions</li>
    <li>Distributing cognitive load and use individualized skills when driving and navigating
    <li>Coding can feel overwhelming, so focusing on one aspect of the job at hand can help focus energy on problem solving</li>
    <li>Two sets of eyes makes it easier to catch mistakes and produce high-quality code</li>
    <li>A pair can hold each other accountable so you'll be less likely to be tempted to take short-cuts or jump around without finishing the task you are on</li>
    <li>Partners help keep the focus on coding and not on distractions like texts, emails, etc</li>
    <li>Talking about your code with a partner will deepen your understanding of programming</li>
</ul>


## Tech Stack

### MVC

`Model` - PostgreSQL, persistence storage, database <br />
`View` - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, "frontend" the aspect of code that you see, click, and navigate, about 20% of the code<br />
`Controller` - Ruby, Ruby on Rails, "backend" the logic, functions, algorithms "under the hood" <br />


## Node on the command line
